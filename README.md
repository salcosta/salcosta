### Hi!

If you are here it means you found one of my projects and want to know more about me...

I have been programming for 25 years. I taught myself BASIC by reading the help file bundled with it and have not stopped since. I have a degree in Computer Science and I have worked just about every job in tech starting as a manual QA tester and working up to an engineering director.

Mostly I work in the world of automation and web development but I have been known to work on mobile apps, small games, other desktop applications - really anything that looks adventurous.

I have no fear when it comes to programming which is another way to say I fail a lot and I am fine with it.

You can find me on Twitter as `anerrantprogrammr` or at http://www.anerrantprogrammer.com/ whenever I am able to fix it!
